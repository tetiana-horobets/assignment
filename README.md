This is a repository containing a task for the internship candidates at yameo.

This repository contains simple Java based project.
The code in this project breaks some of the good design principles - SOLID, DRY, etc. and contains some bugs.

The assignment task is as follows:

1. Please refactor this code so that it follows good design patterns / principles. 
Please fix bugs as you find them. This example is very short, so your solution may seem robust and in some cases over-engineered. This is understandable and will not have a negative impact on the final evaluation of your work.
2. **Please do not rewrite the whole solution from the beginning**. 
Please do work on the existing code and refactor it. 
Please document your changes step by step in the way you find the most convenient.
3. Please add at least one additional shape to the application (you may try adding one before and one after your modifications). 
4. The **deadline** for this assignment is **January the 7th 2018 23:59 CET**. 
Please submit your answer in the way you find the most convenient (email, github / bitbucket / other repo).
5. In case you don't know how the solution should work / behave, 
please use your best judgement and very shortly document / describe the reason behind your choice.

GLHF!
